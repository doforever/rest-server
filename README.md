# Festival web app with booking tickets functionality
This repo is a result of Web Developer bootcamp task of writing a REST server with **Node.js** and **Express**. \
Task consisted of writing a server with required endpoints and establish communication from the client app. \
Client app makes AJAX requests with **Axios** as well as connects via web socket with **socket.oi**. \
Data is stored with **MongoDB** (with **Mongoose**).
There are some backend unit tests implemented with **Mocha** and **Chai**.
